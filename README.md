# Daily-App-Planner

## Description
This application allows the user enter details about their plan by the hour and save it dynamically. When the hour is passed the timeblock is greyed out letting the user know that the hour is passed.
When on the hour, however, the timeblock is colored red so the user knows that is an active timeblock.
And the future timeblocks are colored green so the user knows that the timeblock is in the future.

As the image shows, the user can add events to the timeblock and save them to the timeblock once the save button is clicked on the righ-hand side of the timeblock.
